Trillium is a new kind of "essentials". It is the premium essentials.

This Minecraft plugin is a massive collection of commands, options, and handlers that can turn any vanilla server into a fully equipped server with all the tools necessary to break the barriers of your normal Minecraft server.

Trillium boasts to be the best "essentials" type plugin out there; it aspires to be unique, original, and very aesthetically pleasing as well as filled to the brim with fully customizable and very rich features that will turn your generic vanilla server into a wonder playground of options to modify your server the way you want.

Unlike the famous "Essentials" plugin, Trillium has no unnecessary code that degrades server performance. The original Essentials plugin is fairly over-bloated with useless features that negate the original idea of having only essential features. Trillium, on the other hand, keeps its word by having more features than essentials but only essential ones with more features than essentials ever provided such as the /lag command which gives you statistics on how the server is running and hands you an option to reduce the lag via the garbage collector. And on a finishing note, are you not bored of that generic yellow-ish color scheme found on nearly every single server that runs Essentials?
